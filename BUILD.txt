Build instructions to make a new release:

* ensure ci-build and coverage are OK
* pymake bandit to test for vulnerabilities
* test pyproject.toml validity using https://pypi.org/project/validate-pyproject/
* make a new release and tag on GitHub (tags are necessary for Gentoo builds)
* pymake build (requires pip install py-make)
* wait for cibuildwheel to finish on GitHub Actions, then manually download all builds and place them in the dist folder
* pymake upload
